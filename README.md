Scripts for the generation and analysis of Pathway Crosstalk Perturbation Networks in a murine model of diabetic neuropathy

This repository is a companion to the paper "Pathway crosstalk perturbation networks modeling for identification of connectivity changes induced by diabetic neuropathy and pioglitazone." It includes the pipeline and custom functions used for the analysis of said networks. 

input.txt must be modified in order to run this analysis, to point to local expression matrices and anotation files, as described in it.
